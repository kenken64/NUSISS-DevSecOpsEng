## Design and proposed CI CD pipeline for StoolViriiDetect Pte Ltd COVID19 - Internet of Things Project.

To detect covid19 cluster as early as possible, SG GovHighTech recently awarded StoolViriiDetect Pte Ltd the project to use their stool detection sensor solution in every residential area islandwide. The collected data should be sent to the Health Authority for analysis twice a day via a secure cloud channel. Kindly proposed an end to end CI CD pipeline for this project.

* Public Web App and API with a geolocation-based map showing a possible cluster
* Private Web App with a map showing possible cluster and additional info
* Integrated with the trace together mobile app to notify users that a potential new cluster. (Near to realtime)
* Live update (firmware) to all the deployed sensors
